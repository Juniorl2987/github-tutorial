## Git vs. GitHub

Git is a version system that record changes for code. Git runs in the terminal, it uses a text interface (command line).
The most basic commands that git uses are Mkdir (it creates directories), Touch (creates files), c9 (open files to edit and save), mv (move directories), git add and git commit to save changes but remember you can't git commit before you git add.

Github is cloud based, which means is a place (website) where u can send your repos and share them to others, this also means that you can fork others remote repo and clone it to your local but remember you can't push changes into someone'elses remote.

## Initial Setup

mkdir <name> #to create a dic.
cd <name> #to go into the dic.
touch <name> #to create a file.
c9 <name> #to go into the file.
git add <nameofthefileordic> #to be able to commit
git commit -m "<message>" #to save the changes.

---
## Repository Setup

git remote add origin <link> #to setup
git push -u origin master #to push the saves into the repo.

---
## Workflow & Commands

mkdir <name>
cd <name>
touch <name>
c9 <name>
git add <nameofthefileordic>
git commit -m "<message>"
git remote add origin <link>
git push -u origin master


### Feedback
I think you should explain things in a simplier way, simple enough that even a 1st grader can probably understand it. I don't think you should abbreviate directory,because they won't know what is dic.
